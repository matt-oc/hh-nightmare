# hh form autocomplete

This module exports 2 functions:

```javascript
moneySupermarket()
compareTheMarket()
```

The program can be run by using main.js. It takes about a minute and will visit 
both sites and complete their forms 3 times with 3 different postcodes. 
There are date stamped and stored in their respective folders.

This module is sensitive to a very slow internet connection and to changes on the target websites
